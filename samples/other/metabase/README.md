# Metabase + Postgres

Metabase is a simple and powerful analytics tool which lets anyone learn and make decisions from their companyâ€™s data. This sample demonstrates how to deploy Metabase with Defang. In development, we run a postgres container and in production, we use a managed postgres service. To build the sample, we used Neon, because of their simplicity and generous free tier.


## Prerequisites
1. Download <a href="https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang">Defang CLI</a>
2. Have a managed database service configured and have the connection details ready.
3. (optional) If you are using <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc">Defang BYOC</a>, make sure you have properly <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html">authenticated your AWS account</a>.

## Local

For development, we use a Postgres container. The Postgres container is defined in the `compose.dev.yml` file. The Metabase container is defined in the `compose.yml` file, with some overrides in the `compose.dev.yml` file so it can correctly connect to the development database container.

To start the development environment, run `docker compose -f ./compose.yml -f ./compose.dev.yml up`. This will start the Postgres container and the Metabase container. Metabase will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Since Metabase is a self contained application, there isn't an actual development process, but you can use the development environment to see how Metabase works.

## Deploying

1. Open the terminal and type `defang login`
2. Add your database connection details using `defang config` by typing `defang config set <CONFIG_VAL>` where `<CONFIG_VAL>` is the each of the following `MB_DB_DBNAME`, `MB_DB_HOST`, `MB_DB_PORT`, `MB_DB_USER`, `MB_DB_PASS` (to set the database name, host, port, user, and password respectively). For example `defang config set MB_DB_DBNAME` and pasting your database name.
3. Type `defang compose up` in the CLI.
4. Your app will be running within a few minutes.
