# Monitor a Service

By default, all the output (stdout and stderr) from your app is logged. You can view these logs in real-time. You can view logs for all your services, one service, or even one specific deployment of a service.

- From the CLI:
    
    ```tsx
    defang tail --name service1
    ```
