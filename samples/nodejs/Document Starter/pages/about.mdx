# About Us

We started Defang because, as practitioners with experience in both building cloud apps and cloud platforms, we were unhappy with the state of the art. It remains too difficult to create, deploy, and manage cloud applications. In architecting and building a cloud app, developers need to consider a multitude of factors such as performance, scalability, cost, portability, flexibility, simplicity, etc. At the same time, they face a bewildering array of choices - across application architecture, choice of cloud platforms and services, configuration and deployment settings etc. - that most developers are clearly not the experts in. Clearly, we need a better way.

Improving on this state of affairs is a long journey. It starts by making it radically simpler to create and deploy cloud apps, helping developers to get from idea to deployed app as quickly as possible. We do this by removing as much unnecessary complexity as possible. For example, by leveraging the power of Generative AI, we enable you to instantaneously go from a natural language prompt to initial project outline and code. Once you are done refining that code, we enable you to deploy it to your own cloud account with a single command, with all the proper configuration, security etc. With these capabilities, we make cloud app development a whole lot simpler and accessible to a much broader audience of developers.

This is only the beginning. To make cloud app development truly powerful, it must support the ability to easily evolve app architectures, be portable across different clouds, and offer much higher levels of resilience. These are some of the longer-term objectives we will be working on. We welcome you to join us on this journey!
