# defang
The Defang Opinionated Platform (DOP) is a radically simpler way to build, deploy, and optimize production-ready cloud apps. 
This repo includes:
* Public releases of the Defang CLI; [click here](https://github.com/defang-io/defang/releases/latest/) for the latest version
* Samples in Golang, Python, and Node.js that show how to accomplish various tasks and deploy them to the DOP using a Docker Compose file using the Defang CLI.
* Samples that show how to deploy an app using the Defang Pulumi Provider.
